# KEYLOGGER_PROJECT

🔐 Keylogger Project - Ethical Hacking Internship Submission

📁 Project Files:
- keylogger.exe           → The executable keylogger (runs in background)
- sample_keylog.txt       → Example output of logged keys
- README.txt              → You're reading it!

🧠 How It Works:
1. Logs all keystrokes silently for a fixed duration (default = 1 minute)
2. Saves logs in a hidden folder (AppData)
3. Automatically sends the log to your Gmail using a secure app password

🛠 How to Run:
1. Double-click `keylogger.exe` (runs silently, no visible window)
2. Wait 1 minute (auto stops after that)
3. Check your email inbox for the logs

📦 Optional: You can test this in a virtual machine for demo

⚠️ NOTE: This tool is for educational and ethical use only. Do NOT use it on others' systems without their consent. 
Violation of cyber laws can lead to serious legal consequences.

The compiled .exe version of this project has been intentionally renamed to something less obvious (e.g., Updater.exe, SystemHost.exe, etc.). This is done purely for educational and ethical hacking demonstrations — to mimic how malicious files might try to disguise themselves on a real system.
